# Design and Normalize a Given Database

I was the group leader in this project for CS 331, Database Systems, in which we were given a database that mimicked our college's Spring 2020 semester.
We had to normalize the database, as well as handle any errors that might occur.

This repository contains all the stages of the project:

1. pre-production stage - Designing the new database, and delegation of tasks.  
2. production - the scripts that transferred the data from the given database to the new one.
3. post-production - the presentation we gave that detailed out steps and thought process thoughout the project
